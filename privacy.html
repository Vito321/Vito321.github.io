<b>4. OUR LEGAL BASES FOR COLLECTING, USING, SHARING AND OTHERWISE PROCESSING YOUR INFORMATION</b>
For the purposes of EU law, MyFonts relies on a number of legal bases to collect, use, share, and otherwise process the information we have about you for the purposes described in this Policy. These legal bases include:

<span style="display: inline-block;margin-left:25px">ï Certain processing is needed to provide the Services in accordance with the Terms of Service. </span>
<span style="display: inline-block;margin-left:25px">ï Where you have consented to certain processing. For example we may send you marketing messages if you have consented to receiving them, or we may ask you if you want to take part in voluntary surveys or contests. You may revoke that consent at any time;</span>
<span style="display: inline-block;margin-left:25px">ï For MyFonts to comply with a legal obligation, a court order, or to exercise and defend legal claims, to protect your vital interests or those of others, or where the processing is necessary in the public interest. We may, for instance, share data where we are required by law to do so; and</span>
<span style="display: inline-block;margin-left:25px">ï Some processing is necessary because it is in MyFonts’ or a third party’s legitimate interests.</span>
<span style="display: inline-block;margin-left:25px">ï <b>Our legitimate interests</b></span>

<span style="display: inline-block;margin-left:25px">We process your information in furtherance of the following legitimate interests:</b>

    <div style ="position: relative;left: 44px;top: 18px;float: left;width:2px;height:2px; border: solid 2px; border-radius: 50%; background-color:#222222"></div><span style="display: inline-block;margin-left:70px"><b>Keeping the Services safe and secure:</b> We use your information in an effort to keep our Services safe and secure. We do so as it is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests, the interests of our App and yours, in ensuring MyFonts is secure, and to protect against fraud, spam, misuse and abuse. </span>
    <div style ="position: relative;left: 44px;top: 5px;float: left;width:2px;height:2px; border: solid 2px; border-radius: 50%; background-color:#222222"></div><span style="display: inline-block;margin-left:70px"><b>Providing our Services:</b> We use your information to provide the Services, including any personalized services. We do so as it is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests in providing an innovative and tailored offering to our users on a sustained basis and to provide stable connectivity. For example, where there is poor connectivity, users can experience difficulty in downloading/uploading content. Therefore, MyFonts needs to process log data, including your IP address, to troubleshoot the issue. Without your IP address and location info, it can be hard to address connectivity issues.</span>

<b>5. MANAGING AND DELETING YOUR INFORMATION</b>
We may offer the ability to correct or update the information collected during registration via your account settings on the applicable App or by contacting support and we rely on the accuracy of the information you provide us (such as your age). You may request deletion of your account by contacting support via voicechangeravatar@mail.com.
We retain your information in our server logs, our databases and our records only for as long as necessary in light of the purposes set out in this Policy, subject to any legal obligations to further retain such information. We may use third party service providers to store and maintain such data. We retain your verification-related information for a reasonable period of time, even if you do not complete all verification steps, to assist with future verifications and to prevent abuse of our verification processes. If you decide not to verify the account and would like us to delete the verification information you provided, contact support.
 
<b>6. YOUR RIGHTS</b>
If you reside in certain territories, including the European Economic Area, you benefit from a number of rights in relation to your information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited cases. We describe these rights below in a summary format, but mandated applicable law shall govern.

<span style="display: inline-block;margin-left:25px">ï Where legally required, we can provide your information upon your request. Note that, in accordance with applicable law, information will not be provided where doing so would adversely affect the rights (including the intellectual property rights) of others.</span>
<span style="display: inline-block;margin-left:25px">ï You can also change, restrict, limit or delete much of your information. If you cannot do this, or you do not have a MyFonts account, contact support via voicechangeravatar@mail. We may retain certain information as required by applicable law.</span>
<span style="display: inline-block;margin-left:25px">ï If we process your information based on our legitimate interests explained above, or in the public interest, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will cease processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal reasons. If you live in the European Economic Area, you also have a general right to object to the use of your information for direct marketing purposes.</span>
<span style="display: inline-block;margin-left:25px">ï Where you have previously provided your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your information at any time. For example, you can withdraw your consent to email marketing by following the link provided in a marketing email. If you withdraw your consent to the use of your information for purposes set out in this Policy, you may not have access to all (or any) of our Services and we might not be able to provide you all (or any) of the Services. In certain cases, we may continue to process your information after you have withdrawn consent if we have a legal basis to do so or if your withdrawal of consent was limited to certain processing activities.</span>
<span style="display: inline-block;margin-left:25px">ï If you reside in the European Economic Area, should you wish to raise a concern about our use of your information, you have the right to do so with your local data protection authority.</span>

<b>7. SECURITY</b>
We maintain technical and organizational measures to protect against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to your information.
We try to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks that are presented by the processing and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risk to users. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its security.
 
<b>8. DATA TRANSFERS</b>
When you use our Services your personal information is transferred to the United States or other countries in the world, where the laws protecting privacy may be less stringent than those in your home country. We’re a US company so this transfer is necessary for the performance of our Terms of Service. In certain cases, your data may be transferred to other countries as part of the Services.
We may use a legal mechanism known as "standard contractual clauses" to protect information transferred outside the EU. Standard contractual clauses refer to contracts between companies transferring personal information that contain standard commitments approved by the EU Commission protecting the privacy and security of the information transferred. 
 
<b>9. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</b>
Our Services are intended for general audiences, and are not intended for anyone under 13, anyone under 16 in the European Economic Area or anyone under the minimum age to use the Services in the jurisdiction where they reside ("Minimum Age"). Persons under the Minimum age are prohibited from using our Services and we do not knowingly collect information from such individuals. If we become aware that a child under the Minimum Age has provided us with their information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the account, unless proper parental consent is received by MyFonts.
 
<b>10. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</b>
We reserve the right to amend or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Please see over this page from time to time to check if there are any changes that we made. If you do not agree with any changes, please do not continue to use our Services.
